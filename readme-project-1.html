<h1>CPSC 411 - Stage 1: Parsing</h1>
<p>In
this stage of the project we are grouping together the work described
in Chapters 2, 3 and 4 of the book. The goal of this stage is to
produce (and test) a working parser for MiniJava. It accepts a single
source file as input and produces a parse tree.</p><h2>Tools</h2><p>The
book proposes two useful parsing tools: JavaCC and SableCC. We are
going to use JavaCC. The first thing you will want to do is install the
<a href="http://eclipse-javacc.sourceforge.net/">JavaCC Eclipse plugin</a>. This will make it easy for you to integrate the use of JavaCC into your development process.</p><p>Documentation on using JavaCC is <a href="https://javacc.dev.java.net/doc/docindex.html">here</a>.</p><h2>Project Setup</h2><p>The
zip file in which these instructions are contained is an archived copy
of an Eclipse project. To import this project into Eclipse do as
follows:</p><ol><li>Select "File &gt; Import" Menu.</li><li>Select "General &gt; Existing Projects into Workspace".</li><li>Select&nbsp;"Select Archive file" and Browse for this .zip file.</li><li>Select&nbsp;the project and click "Finish".</li></ol><p>As in assignment 2, the project is set up with a number of JUnit tests. The provided tests should be thought of&nbsp;as an <span style="font-weight: bold;">executable specification</span>. This means that<span style="font-weight: bold;"> you should not change any code in the test classes</span>.&nbsp;Otherwise
you are free to change any and all code in the project. We also
encourage you to create additional tests, to more thoroughly test your
solution.</p><p>Test classes,<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></span>who's
name contains the word "Internal" are an exception to the "don't change
the tests" rule. These tests are intended to test a chunk of
functionality that is "internal" to your solution. You may in fact
chose to change these tests. For example, in this project a file
Test2LexInternal tests your scanner. As such it is dependent on
specific choices of token names. However only the parser itself
actually depends on these implementation details, so you could choose
to change the names given to different token classes without breaking
the implicit contract the parser has with the rest of the code. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></p><p>The project has the
following layout:</p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">src</span>:
directory with all the project source code including the following packages.</li><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.test.parser:</span> JUnit tests for this phase of the project.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.test: </span>Contains some support code for the tests.</li></ul><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.ast</span>: AST classes already implemented for you.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.visitor: </span>contains a basic "Visitor" infrastructure for the AST classes, including a PrettyPrintVisitor. </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.parser: </span>A package containing a MiniJavaParser class that is called by the test code.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.parser.jcc: </span>This
package is currently empty except for a readme file. The intention is
that you will place your .jj file here and keep all the files generated
by JavaCC confined to this package. Except for the stubs in
minijava.parser there will be no calls directly to the generated code.</li></ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">sample: </span>directory containing the sample MiniJava program that come with the textbook online material.</li><li>readme*.html: Readme files about the project.</li><li>files starting with a "." : various settings that tell
Eclipse how to compile and run the project.</li></ul>
<h2>How to get started</h2><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,'sans serif';"></span><p>Many classes in the starter code are heavily commented and provide explanation about the code, as well as some explanation
on what you are supposed to do and how. In particular, the following
are good places to start:</p>
<ul><li>The README file at the toplevel of the src directory.</li><li>The README file in the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.parser.jcc </span>package.</li><li>The comments in <span style="font-weight: bold;">MiniJavaParser.java</span> in the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.parser</span> package<span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span></li><li>The comments in the test files <span style="font-weight: bold;">Test2LexInternal.java</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Test3Parse.java</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Test4Parse.java</span>.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></li><li>You should also read Chapter 2,3 and 4 of the textbook.</li></ul><p>One
further note: although you are allowed to change all code&nbsp;except
for the tests, this does not mean that you actually have to change any
code at all! In fact, you can complete this assignment simply by
providing an appropriate <span style="font-weight: bold;">MiniJava.jj</span> file in <span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.parser.jcc&nbsp;</span>package.</p><h2>Handing In</h2>
<p>Only one of the team members should hand in for your team. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Make sure you have filled in the names of each team member in the src/README.txt file</span>. </p><p>The name of this project stage for the electronic handin is <b>
project1</b>. Pleas use the <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/ugrad/facilities/windows/handin.shtml">handin
web-interface</a>.</p>
<p>You should handin the entire contents of your project's src
directory, excluding the test files&nbsp; which you were not supposed
to change. We have provided a <span style="font-weight: bold;">build.xml</span> script in the src directory that packages up the correct files in a .zip file. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Please use this script</span>, it will ensure a uniform layout for all handed in materials, which makes it easier for the TA mark efficiently.</p><h3>Copying and Plagiarism Policy</h3><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,'sans serif';"></span><p>Please read the departmental policy on Plagiarism and Collaboration <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/about/policies/collaboration.shtml">here</a>.</p><p>Plagiarism
means passing of someone else's work as your own. Plagiarism is a
serious offense and dealt with quite harshly by the
university. Suspected cases are forwarded to the Dean's office and can
result in suspension from the university as well as an entry on your
academic transcript.</p><p>The key to using other people's code without
commiting plagiarism is to make it absolutely clear how much of
your assignment is your own work and how much it is&nbsp;based on someone else's
work. When copying something, or adapting it as part of your solution, <span style="font-weight: bold;">you are fully responsible to provide clear references to your</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">sources</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">and to what extent your solution is based on these sources</span>. Code comments are a good way to do that for programming assignments.</p><p>For
the MiniJava project you will work in teams. It is expected that the
work submitted as a team is collaborative work. As such we will treat
the code as being developed by all team members together. We do not
require you to provide comments about the details of exactly which team member wrote
every single line of code. However, if we suspect
there is an imbalance in the contributions made by each team member, we
may ask for clarification and we may reflect this imbalance in your
final marks.&nbsp;</p><p>You are not supposed to copy code or
otherwise collaborate with people other than those on your own project team. If
you do, then you can still submit your work for partial credit,
provided that you provide adequate documentation of your sources and
the extent to which your solution is derived from them.</p><p>When
you are provided starter code, as is the case in most of our assignments and project drops, it is
automatically assumed that you did not write the starter code yourself.
It is therefore not necessary to provide explicit documentation to explain this
obvious fact. On the other hand, it is automatically assumed that <span style="font-weight: bold;">you
are claiming any code that differs from the original starter code as
entirely your own work. If this is not the case, you are fully
responsible to provide a clear and complete explanation of this fact.</span> Any failure to do so will be considered academic misconduct. Forgetfulness is not an excuse.</p></body></html>
