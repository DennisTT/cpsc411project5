<h1>CPSC 411 - Stage 5: Liveness Analysis</h1>
<p>In
this stage of the project we will implement the analyses from Chapter 10:</p><ol><li>Construction of a Flow graph.</li><li>Liveness analysis: compute the liveOut set for each node in the flow graph.</li><li>Construct
an interference graph: use the flow graph and liveness info to create a
graph that indicates which Temps can not be allocated to the same
register.</li></ol><p>Liveness information is useful for many
optimizations. However in our compiler we use it only to construct an
interference graph which will be used in the next stage of our compiler
(Project 6) to do register allocation (Since we are little bit behind schedule we are planning to provide you with
register allocation).&nbsp;</p><h2>Project Setup</h2><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">Warning:</span>
Before installing the new files, it is advisable to make a backup copy of
your project. Otherwise you run the risk of overwriting any
changes you have made to some of the files that were provided in earlier phases.</p><p>The
zip file in which these instructions are contained is an archived copy
of an Eclipse project. To import this project into Eclipse do as
follows:</p><ol><li>Select "File &gt; Import" Menu.</li><li>Select "General &gt; Existing Projects into Workspace".</li><li>Select&nbsp;"Select Archive file" and Browse for this .zip file.</li><li>Select&nbsp;the project and click "Finish".</li></ol><p>The project is set up with a number of JUnit tests. The provided tests should be thought of&nbsp;as an <span style="font-weight: bold;">executable specification</span>. This means that<span style="font-weight: bold;"> you should not change any code in the test classes</span>.&nbsp;Otherwise
you are free to change any and all code in the project. We also
encourage you to create additional tests, to more thoroughly test your
solution.</p><p>Test classes<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></span>who's
name contains the word "Internal" are an exception to the "don't change
the tests" rule. These tests are intended to test a chunk of
functionality that is "internal" to your solution.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></p><p>The project contains the same files from the previous stage with the following new files:</p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">src</span></li><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.test.analysis</span> Tests for this stage of the compiler.</li></ul><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.analysis:&nbsp;</span>This package contains the code for this stage (and later on, in project 6) we will also add the code for register allocation).</li></ul><ul><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">util:</span> This sub package contains some useful utility classes.</li><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">graph: </span>An implementation of a data structure to represent a (directed) graph with nodes and edges.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">ActiveSet.java</span>:
A utility class that can be used to help solve data flow equations such
as those for liveness analysis (see the example package or the lecture
slides for examples).<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li></ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">implementation: </span>create this package and try to keep all your code confined to this package as much as possible.</li><li>other .java files: the "interfaces" for the different analyses in this compiler stage.</li></ul></ul></ul><h2>Inheritance</h2><p>The
implementation of inheritance in MiniJava is optional. We may come back
to this later if we have time to cover the material from Chapter 14 of
the textbook. You may attempt to implement inheritance support if you like an extra challenge.</p><ul><ul><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,'sans serif';"></span></ul></ul>
<h2>How to get started</h2><p>The
tests for this part of the assignment are in minijava.test.analysis. You should work on them in the following order:</p><ol><li>TestFlowGraph.java</li><li>TestInternalLiveness.java</li><li>TestInterference.java</li></ol><p>The reason for this ordering is, of course, because each one depends on the result of the preceding ones.</p><p>The directory <span style="font-weight: bold;">sample_analysis_output</span>
contains captured output from running some of the tests on my completed
implementation. You can take a look at this if you want to get a rough
idea of the kind of output that should be produced.</p><p>Things to read:</p><ul><li>Chapter 10 of the book.</li><li>The slides for Chapter 10.</li></ul><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,'sans serif';"></span><h2>Handing In</h2>
<p>Only one of the team members should hand in for your team. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Make sure you have filled in the names of each team member in the src/README_stage5.txt file</span>. </p><p>The name of this project stage for the electronic handin is <b>
project5</b>. Please use the <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/ugrad/facilities/windows/handin.shtml">handin
web-interface</a>.</p>
<p>You should handin the entire contents of your project's src
directory, excluding the test files. We have provided a <span style="font-weight: bold;">build.xml</span> script in the src directory that packages up the correct files in a .zip file. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Please use this script</span>, it will ensure a uniform layout for all handed in materials, which makes it easier for the TA.</p></body></html>
