<h1>CPSC 411 - Stage 4: Instruction Selection</h1>
<p>In
this stage of the project we are doing the work described
in Chapters 9 of the book. This stage of the compiler is responsible
for converting the IR code into assembly language for particular target
architecture (x86 in our case).</p><h2>Project Setup</h2><p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">Warning:</span>
Before installing the new files, it is advisable to make a backup copy of
your project. Otherwise you run the risk of overwriting any
changes you have made to some of the files that were provided in earlier phases.</p><p>The
zip file in which these instructions are contained is an archived copy
of an Eclipse project. To import this project into Eclipse do as
follows:</p><ol><li>Select "File &gt; Import" Menu.</li><li>Select "General &gt; Existing Projects into Workspace".</li><li>Select&nbsp;"Select Archive file" and Browse for this .zip file.</li><li>Select&nbsp;the project and click "Finish".</li></ol><p>The project is set up with a number of JUnit tests. The provided tests should be thought of&nbsp;as an <span style="font-weight: bold;">executable specification</span>. This means that<span style="font-weight: bold;"> you should not change any code in the test classes</span>.&nbsp;Otherwise
you are free to change any and all code in the project. We also
encourage you to create additional tests, to more thoroughly test your
solution.</p><p>Test classes<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></span>who's
name contains the word "Internal" are an exception to the "don't change
the tests" rule. These tests are intended to test a chunk of
functionality that is "internal" to your solution.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></p><p>The project contains the same files from the previous stage with the following new files:</p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">src</span></li><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.test.codegen</span>: Tests for this stage of the compiler.</li></ul><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.codegen:&nbsp;</span>This package contains the instruction selection implementation&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">assem:</span> This sub package corresponds to the Assem package from the textbook.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">patterns: </span>This sub package provides a pattern matching infrastructure to create and match patterns to IR trees (as explained in lecture).</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">muncher:</span> This sub package defines the class Muncher. You implement your X86Muncher as a subclass of Muncher.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">X86MuncherExample.java</span>:&nbsp; An example of how to create a subclass of Muncher.</li></ul></ul></ul><p>A
few files where changed compared to the previous project drop. Most of
them are inconsequential typos in comments, but one of them is
significant:</p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">src&nbsp;</span></li><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">minijava.ir:</span>&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">frame:&nbsp;</span>Some methods where added to the Frame class.</li></ul></ul></ul><h2>Inheritance</h2><p>The
implementation of inheritance in MiniJava is optional. We may come back
to this later if we have time to cover the material from Chapter 14 of
the textbook. You may attempt to implement inheritance support if you like an extra challenge.</p><ul><ul><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,'sans serif';"></span></ul></ul>
<h2>How to get started</h2><p>The
tests for this part of the assignment are in minijava.test.codegen. As
always you are free to change any/all code you wish as long as you
don't break the provided tests.</p><p>However,
you are essentially
provided with a "complete" implementation of a generic Maximal munch
code generator. To make this generic implementation work for a
specific target architecture, it needs to be initialized with a set of
architecture specific MunchRules. To provide your definition of these
rules proceed as follows:</p><ol><li>Create a package minijava.codegen.x86 (try to keep all your code in here).</li><li>Copy the class X86MuncherExample.java into this package and rename it to X86Muncher.java.</li><li>Provide
an appropriate implementation of the "newMuncher" method in your X86Frame
class (it should create an instance of X86Muncher).</li><li>Add
more and more rules to your X86Muncher class, until you are satisfied
that it produces "good" X86 code from the IR, for all the Unit tests.</li></ol><p>Things to read and browse:</p><ol><li>Chapter 9 of the book.</li><li>The slides on "Instruction Selection" (for some extra info on the pattern and munch rule framework)</li><li>Explore the code in the codegen.assem and codegen.muncher packages if you are not certain how some of it works.</li></ol><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,'sans serif';"></span><h2>Handing In</h2>
<p>Only one of the team members should hand in for your team. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Make sure you have filled in the names of each team member in the src/README_stage4.txt file</span>. </p><p>The name of this project stage for the electronic handin is <b>
project4</b>. Please use the <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/ugrad/facilities/windows/handin.shtml">handin
web-interface</a>.</p>
<p>You should handin the entire contents of your project's src
directory, excluding the test files. We have provided a <span style="font-weight: bold;">build.xml</span> script in the src directory that packages up the correct files in a .zip file. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Please use this script</span>, it will ensure a uniform layout for all handed in materials, which makes it easier for the TA.</p><h3>Copying and Plagiarism Policy</h3><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,'sans serif';"></span><p>Please read the departmental policy on Plagiarism and Collaboration <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/about/policies/collaboration.shtml">here</a>.</p><p>Plagiarism
means passing of someone else's work as your own. Plagiarism is a
serious offense and dealt with quite harshly by the
university. Suspected cases are forwarded to the Dean's office and can
result in suspension from the university as well as an entry on your
academic transcript.</p><p>The key to using other people's code without
committing plagiarism is to make it absolutely clear how much of
your assignment is your own work and how much it is&nbsp;based on someone else's
work. When copying something, or adapting it as part of your solution, <span style="font-weight: bold;">you are fully responsible to provide clear references to your</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">sources</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">and to what extent your solution is based on these sources</span>. Code comments are a good way to do that for programming assignments.</p><p>For
the MiniJava project you will work in teams. It is expected that the
work submitted as a team is collaborative work. As such we will treat
the code as being developed by all team members together. We do not
require you to provide comments about the details of exactly which team member wrote
every single line of code. However, if we suspect
there is an imbalance in the contributions made by each team member, we
may ask for clarification and we may reflect this imbalance in your
final marks.&nbsp;</p><p>You are not supposed to copy code or
otherwise collaborate with people other than those on your own project team. If
you do, then you can still submit your work for partial credit,
provided that you provide adequate documentation of your sources and
the extent to which your solution is derived from them.</p><p>When
you are provided starter code, as is the case in most of our assignments and project drops, it is
automatically assumed that you did not write the starter code yourself.
It is therefore not necessary to provide explicit documentation to explain this
obvious fact. On the other hand, it is automatically assumed that <span style="font-weight: bold;">you
are claiming any code that differs from the original starter code as
entirely your own work. If this is not the case, you are fully
responsible to provide a clear and complete explanation of this fact.</span> Any failure to do so will be considered academic misconduct. Forgetfulness is not an excuse.</p></body></html>
