This README file is intended for comments the TA should read before 
marking your project.

At the very least YOU MUST INCLUDE THE NAMES OF EACH MEMBER OF YOUR TEAM.

Team member 1: Jeff Cheung  66994062  p3c6
Team member 2: Dennis Tsang 69972065  s0g6

If you changed any code outside of the minjava.codegen.x86 package, 
please include a *brief* explanation here what you changed and why:

  None
  
Additional comments to the TA (if any): 

  We had problems getting JUnit to run Test4Parse tests in the correct order
  when running all tests for the project at once.  However if the Test4Parse
  test suite is run independently, its tests pass.
